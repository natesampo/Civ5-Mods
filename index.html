		<h1>GLOBAL CHANGES</h1>
		
All civs now get 8 more local happiness in the Capitol, 3 more gold per turn, and 2 more science per turn to start.
		
The first civilization to successfully circumnavigate the globe receives 1 extra naval movement point.
		
		<h2>FREE BUILDINGS</h2>

Fixed consistency issues with free buildings in game.<br><br>

Old - Free monuments used to cost no maintenance while free courthouses cost their normal maintenance. Free aqueducts used be granted even if you didn’t have the tech, while free amphitheatres would only appear once you researched the tech.<br><br>

New - Free buildings all cost gold maintenance, and are only free in the sense that they are granted to you with no need for production. Additionally, you may receive buildings even if you do not have the tech for them. When you receive a free Defensive building from Tradition, if you have already built Walls, you will receive a Castle, even if you do not have the Chivalry technology.
